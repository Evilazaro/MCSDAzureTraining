# Federated Authentication in a Microsoft Azure Cloud Service #

---

<a name="Overview"></a>
## Overview ##

This hands-on lab provides step-by-step guides for hosting in Microsoft Azure a Cloud Service accepting identities from an external identity provider: with the authentication functions being performed by an external identity provider, you are now free to focus on the business function of your application instead of worrying of low level details. As you will learn while you go through the lab, this is easily accomplished by taking advantage of Windows Identity Foundation (WIF) for enhancing your services.

The text gives very concrete indications, and it is optimized for minimizing the number of steps that are necessary for getting up and running with the minimal scenario. We will occasionally add notes in the text to explain choices rationales and indicate alternatives for the reader who is interested in understanding how the solution works or wants to explore more advanced scenarios: if all you are interested in is getting the basic scenario up and running, you can safely skip those notes as you follow the lab instructions.

### Essential Introduction to Windows Identity Foundation for Microsoft Azure developers ###

Windows® Identity Foundation (WIF) is a developer framework which enhances the .NET Framework with advanced identity capabilities. Based on the concept of Claims Based access, WIF offers a series of classes that, while integrating seamlessly with the traditional .NET identity object model, gives developers control over every aspect of authentication, authorization and identity-driven application behavior. WIF point & click tooling and tight Visual Studio integration make very easy to externalize authentication to a federated partner, so that a developer can configure an ASP.NET application or a WCF service to rely on external entities for identity management. WIF allows application access using open protocols and standards, while hiding the complexity of the security plumbing behind a handy programming model. WIF will work with applications written with the .NET Framework 3.5 SP2 or higher.

### Essential Introduction to Microsoft Azure for Windows Identity Foundation developers  ###

Windows® Azure is a cloud services operating system that serves as the development, service hosting and service management environment of either consumer Web or enterprise scenarios. Microsoft Azure provides developers with on-demand compute and storage to host, scale, and manages Web applications on the Internet through Microsoft® data centers.

Microsoft Azure offers a set of Visual Studio templates that can be used to develop ASP.NET applications or worker services destined to be deployed in the cloud. The Microsoft Azure Tool for Visual Studio includes the Microsoft Azure compute emulator, a hosting environment that can be used for local simulation of execution in the fabric. The Microsoft Azure compute emulator gives you the chance to experiment with multiple concurrent instances and other cloud features without the need to be online, while still being able to use your familiar debugging and development tools.

Microsoft Azure applications can be packaged via Visual Studio or command-line tooling, and then deployed in the cloud via the [Microsoft Azure management portal] (https://manage.windowsazure.com/). 

You can find further information at <http://www.windowsazure.com> in order to able to deploy your project. 

<a name="Objectives"></a>
### Objectives ###

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to:

- Create a simple ASP.NET web site in a Microsoft Azure Web Role project, and configure it to rely on an external federated entity for authentication. The federated partner will be simulated by a local development security token service (STS).
- Test the Microsoft Azure Web role project in the local Microsoft Azure compute emulator.

- [optional] Deploy the Microsoft Azure project in the cloud and test it with the local development STS both from staging and production environment.

### Setup ###

In order to execute the exercises in this hands-on lab you need to set up your environment.

1. Open a Windows Explorer window and browse to the lab's **Source** folder.

1. Run the **Setup.cmd** file in this folder with Administrator privileges to launch the setup process that will configure your environment and install the Visual Studio code snippets for this lab. This will also install the localhost certificate used by the local STS.

1. If the User Account Control dialog is shown, confirm the action to proceed.

>**Note:** Make sure you have checked all the dependencies for this lab before running the setup.

>The procedure installs a self-signed certificate to enable the SSL binding. If you already have a certificate with subject name CN=localhost, you must back up the certificate and restore after completing the steps in this guide.

<a name="CodeSnippets"></a>
### Using the Code Snippets ###

Throughout the lab document, you will be instructed to insert code blocks. For your convenience, most of that code is provided as Visual Studio Code Snippets, which you can use from within Visual Studio 2010 to avoid having to add it manually.

## Exercises ##

This hands-on lab includes the following exercise:

1. [Enabling Federated Authentication for ASP.NET applications in Microsoft Azure](#Exercise1)
	
Estimated time to complete this lab: **60 minutes**.

>**Note:** Each exercise is accompanied by a starting solution located in the Begin folder of the exercise that allows you to follow each exercise independently of the others. Please be aware that the code snippets that are added during an exercise are missing from these starting solutions and that they will not necessarily work until you complete the exercise. Inside the source code for an exercise, you will also find an End folder containing a Visual Studio solution with the code that results from completing the steps in the corresponding exercise. You can use these solutions as guidance if you need additional help as you work through this hands-on lab.
>
>When you first start Visual Studio, you must select one of the predefined settings collections. Every predefined collection is designed to match a particular development style and determines window layouts, editor behavior, IntelliSense code snippets, and dialog box options. The procedures in this lab describe the actions necessary to accomplish a given task in Visual Studio when using the **General Development Settings** collection. If you choose a different settings collection for your development environment, there may be differences in these procedures that you need to take into account.

<a name="Exercise1"></a>
### Exercise 1: Enabling Federated Authentication for ASP.NET applications in Microsoft Azure ###

Securing an ASP.NET web site with WIF is very simple. Within Visual Studio you right-click the project, run an easy wizard in which you indicate from which federated partner you want to accept identities, and you are done. You even have the option to generate on the fly a local development STS which can be used if you do not have federated partners available at development time.

That simple procedure remains largely unchanged even when you are targeting Microsoft Azure as the deployment environment for your application: the few adjustments you need to apply are mainly related to the structural features of Microsoft Azure, such as the way in which X509 certificates are stored or how application URIs are handled across the different environments (Microsoft Azure compute emulator, Staging, Production).

In the following tasks, you will see how to create a Microsoft Azure WebRole, configure it to use a local development STS and modify the Microsoft Azure project in order to work in the Microsoft Azure compute emulator by still referencing the local development STS. Finally, you will publish the project in the cloud and see how the application still works with the local development STS when running in the staging and production environments.

This hands-on lab demonstrates the minimal integration scenario between WIF and Microsoft Azure. You can easily extend what you will learn here to more realistic scenarios, such as the case in which you want to reuse on-premises identities exposed via AD FS 2.0 (formerly known as "Geneva" Server). You will discover that the process is even simpler.

![Exercise Summary](images/exercise-summary.png?raw=true "Exercise Summary")

_A summary of the steps followed by this exercise_

You start by creating an ASP.NET  website (RP) in a Microsoft Azure Web Role and an STS for it in the same Visual Studio solution and you establish trust between the two. Upon successful testing you publish & test the WebRole in staging and finally in production. The STS used at all stages is the one hosted by the local IIS: this is done to simplify the deployment of this guide on dev machines, but if you have a production STS available you can certainly use it in lieu of the test one._

#### Task 1 - Creating a Microsoft Azure Project and Preparing it for Using Windows Identity Foundation ####

1. Open Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 with administrator privileges. In **Start | All Programs | Microsoft Visual Studio 2010**, right-click **Microsoft Visual Studio 2010** and select **Run as administrator**.
1. In the **File** menu, choose **New** and then **Project**. 
1. In the **New Project** dialog, select **Cloud** in the **Templates** list under **Visual C#** node.
1. Select **Microsoft Azure Project** as project type.
1. Choose a suitable name for your solution. Keep in mind that the name must be unique because it will be publicly visible when deployed to Microsoft Azure. Set the solution name **Begin** and the location to the **\Source\Ex1-AzureFederatedAuthentication\** folder. Make sure that **Create directory for solution** is checked and the framework is **.NET Framework 4**. Click **OK** to create the project.

	![Creating a new Microsoft Azure Project](images/creating-a-new-windows-azure-project.png?raw=true "Creating a new Microsoft Azure Project")

	_Creating a new Microsoft Azure Project_

	> **Note:** **Why do we require you to choose your own project name, instead of providing a sample solution?**

	> Every Microsoft Azure service is published on an URI of the form **\<projectname\>.cloudapp.net**.
	
	> The string \<projectname\> must be unique, since it has to be resolvable on the public internet. 
	
	> For the first steps of this hand-on lab, you could technically use any project name youd like, since all addresses will be resolved locally. You are forced to pick a unique name (and adjust the configurations accordingly) only at the moment in which you deploy your application in production.

	> The steps in this guide are more easily understood if the naming convention is coherent, hence we suggest you adhere to it at least the first time you go through it. If you want to adapt the instructions to the name you will choose, simply substitute **fabrikamair** with your own project name when following a procedure.

1. In the **New Microsoft Azure Project** dialog, expand the Roles panel for Visual C#, select **ASP.NET Web Role** from the list of available roles and click the arrow (**>**) to add an instance of this role to the solution. Before closing the dialog, select the new role in the right panel, click the pencil icon and rename the role to **FederatedIdentity_WebRole**. Click **OK** to create the Microsoft Azure project solution.

	![Assigning roles to the Microsoft Azure project](images/assigning-roles-to-the-windows-azure-project.png?raw=true "Assigning roles to the Microsoft Azure project")

	_Assigning roles to the Microsoft Azure project_

1. Generate a self-signed certificate for the application to use SSL. For your convenience, the lab material includes a script that performs the necessary actions. It creates the certificate using the subject you specify, installs it to the **LocalMachine/Personal** certificate store and adds the certificate to the **LocalMachine/Trusted Root Certification Authorities** store (to avoid the certificate error warning when browsing the site with IE). Open a Visual Studio command prompt as an administrator. To do this, open **Start | All Programs | Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 | Visual Studio Tools**, right-click **Visual Studio Command Prompt (2010)** and choose **Run as administrator**.

1. Change the current directory to the **\Source\Assets** folder, and execute the **CreateCert.cmd** script specifying the name of your project as a parameter. 

	>**Note:** **VERY IMPORTANT!** make sure to use **lower casing** for the certificate name.

	For example:
	
	<!--mark: 1-->
	````VisualStudioCommandPrompt
	CreateCert.cmd yourprojectname
	````

	While running the script you will be asked to enter a password to secure your private key, type _abc!123_ and press **OK**.

	![Specifying a password to secure your private key ](images/specifying-a-password-to-secure-your-private.png?raw=true "Specifying a password to secure your private key ")

	_Specifying a password to secure your private key_

	![Specifying a password to secure your private key](images/specifying-a-password-to-secure-your-priva-2.png?raw=true "Specifying a password to secure your private key")

	_Specifying a password to secure your private key_

	When you add the certificate to the **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** store, you are presented with a warning. Click **Yes** to install the certificate.

	![Adding a certificate as a trusted root](images/adding-a-certificate-as-a-trusted-root.png?raw=true "Adding a certificate as a trusted root")

	_Adding a certificate as a trusted root_

1. Go to the Solution Explorer; navigate to **\<yourproject\>/Roles/FederatedIdentity_WebRole**. Right-click on it and choose Properties.

	![Modifying FederatedIdentity_Webrole properties](images/modifying-federatedidentitywebrole-properties.png?raw=true "Modifying FederatedIdentity_Webrole properties")

	_Modifying FederatedIdentity_Webrole properties_

1. Go to the **Configuration** Tab and ensure that the **Full Trust** option is set.

	![FederatedIdentity_WebRole is set to full trust so WIF work as expected](images/federatedidentitywebrole-is-set-to-full-trust.png?raw=true "FederatedIdentity_WebRole is set to full trust so WIF work as expected")

	_FederatedIdentity_WebRole is set to full trust so WIF work as expected_

	> **Note:** **Why do you need to set .NET trust level to Full Trust?**

	> Windows Identity Foundation relies on Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) for handling various cryptography and protocol related operations. Today those parts of WCF require full trust to execute correctly, hence the Enable Full Trust requirement.

	> Furthermore, the Windows Identity Foundation assemblies are not available in the Global Assembly Cache seen by Microsoft Azure projects (see below); hence partial trust execution would not be possible in any case.

1. Go to the **Certificates** Tab and click on **Add Certificate**.

	![Selecting Add Certificate](images/selecting-add-certificate.png?raw=true "Selecting Add Certificate")

	_Selecting Add Certificate_

1. Type your \<**projectName**> in the Name field and click on the Thumbprint column to select the cert you generated previously. 

	![Selecting the certificate previously added](images/selecting-the-certificate-previously-added.png?raw=true "Selecting the certificate previously added")

	_Selecting the certificate previously added_

1. In the Endpoints tab, add a new Https endpoint. Click **Add Endpoint**, and set the following values:
	- **Name**: HttpsIn
	- **Type**: Input
	- **Protocol**: https
	- **Public Port**: 8080
	- **SSL Certificate Name**: \<yourprojectname\>

	![Adding a Https endpoint](images/adding-a-https-endpoint.png?raw=true "Adding a Https endpoint")

	_Adding a Https endpoint_

1. Remove the HTTP endpoint. Select the existing Endpoint1 and click **Remove Endpoint**.

	![Removing the Http endpoint](images/removing-the-http-endpoint.png?raw=true "Removing the Http endpoint")

	_Removing the Http endpoint_

1. Press **Ctrl-S** to save the properties.

1. Go to **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **FederatedIdentity_WebRole** project and choose **Add Reference**. In the **.NET** tab, select **Microsoft.IdentityModel** and click **OK**.

1. Go to the **References** folder for the **FederatedIdentity_WebRole** project, select **Microsoft.IdentityModel**. Press **F4** to open the **Properties** window and set **Copy Local** to **True** and **Specific Version** to **False**.

	> **Note:** **Why do you need to set Copy Local to True for the reference to Microsoft.IdentityModel?**

	> Microsoft.IdentityModel is the main Windows Identity Foundation assembly. As mentioned above, such assembly is not available in the Global Assembly Cache that is visible to Microsoft Azure applications. By setting its Copy Local property to True, you ensure that the bits of the assembly will be included in the project package. Therefore, once you deploy it in the cloud, this will ensure that the WIF is deployed too and available to your application.

1. Update the using statements into **Default.aspx.cs** in **FederatedIdentity_WebRole**. 

	(Code Snippet - _Federated Authentication for WebRole Guide - RP Usings_)
	<!--mark: 7-8-->
	````C#
	using System;
	using System.Collections.Generic;
	using System.Linq;
	using System.Web;
	using System.Web.UI;
	using System.Web.UI.WebControls;
	using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Claims;
	using System.Threading;
	````
1. Insert the following code into the body of the **Page_Load** handler **Default.aspx.cs** in **FederatedIdentity_WebRole**. 

	(Code Snippet - _Federated Authentication for WebRole Guide - RP Page_Load Body_)
	<!--mark: 7-11-->
	````C#
	namespace FederatedIdentity_WebRole
	{
		public partial class _Default : System.Web.UI.Page
		{
			protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
			{
				IClaimsPrincipal icp = Thread.CurrentPrincipal as IClaimsPrincipal;
				IClaimsIdentity ici = icp.Identity as IClaimsIdentity;
				Response.Write("Welcome to Fabrikamair <br/><br/>:Claims:<br/>");
				foreach (Claim c in ici.Claims)
				Response.Write(c.ClaimType + "-" + c.Value + "<br/>");
			}
		}
	}
	````

1. Open the Default.aspx file and replace its content with the following.

	<!--mark: 1-->
	````HTML
		<%@ Page Title="Home Page" Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeBehind="Default.aspx.cs" Inherits="FederatedIdentity_WebRole._Default" %>
	````

1. In the **FederetedIdentity_WebRole** project, double-click the **Global.asax** file. Replace the current using statements with the following:

	(Code Snippet - _Federated Authentication for WebRole Guide - RP Global.asax Using_)
	<!--mark: 1-7-->
	````C#
	using System;
	using System.Collections.Generic;
	using System.Web;
	using System.Text;
	using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens;
	using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Web;
	using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Web.Configuration;
	````
 
1. Add the **WSFederationAuthenticationModule_RedirectingToIdentityProvider** method as follows:

	(Code Snippet - _Federated Authentication for WebRole Guide - RP Global.asax RedirectingToIdentityProvider_)
	<!--mark: 4-27-->
	````C#
	public class Global : System.Web.HttpApplication
	{
	  ...
	  /// <summary>
	  /// Retrieves the address that was used in the browser for accessing 
	  /// the web application, and injects it as WREPLY parameter in the
	  /// request to the STS 
	  /// </summary>
	  void WSFederationAuthenticationModule_RedirectingToIdentityProvider(object sender, RedirectingToIdentityProviderEventArgs e)
	  {
		//
		// In the Microsoft Azure environment, build a wreply parameter for  the SignIn request
		// that reflects the real address of the application.
		//
		HttpRequest request = HttpContext.Current.Request;
		Uri requestUrl = request.Url;
		StringBuilder wreply = new StringBuilder();
	
		wreply.Append(requestUrl.Scheme);     // e.g. "http" or "https"
		wreply.Append("://");
		wreply.Append(request.Headers["Host"] ?? requestUrl.Authority);
		wreply.Append(request.ApplicationPath);
	
		if (!request.ApplicationPath.EndsWith("/"))
			wreply.Append("/");
		e.SignInRequestMessage.Reply = wreply.ToString();
	  }
	...
	}
	````
	
	> **Note:** **What is the WSFederationAuthenticationModule_RedirectingToIdentityProvidermethod for?**
	
	> The federated sign on process implemented by WIF is based on the WS-Federation protocol. Unauthenticated users landing on the web site are redirected to the trusted STS for authentication and token issuance. The URI used for the redirection contains a number of parameters, mainly retrieved from the website Web.config: among those, there is the address to which the STS will have to redirect the users browser once successfully authenticated. In the default case, WIF retrieves that return address from the configuration settings generated by the Federation Utility wizard. 

	> In Microsoft Azure this approach would not work as is: an application hosted in Microsoft Azure will have a different URI depending on the environment in which it is hosted (Microsoft Azure compute emulator, staging, production) hence one would have to continuously change the values in the Web.config before deploying. In fact, even that strategy would not work in all cases since in the staging environment you learn what URI has been assigned to your app only AFTER you deployed the project.
	
	> The current solution to this is finding out at runtime what the address of the app is, and injecting it in the request to the STS as wreply parameter. An STS receiving a wreply would use its value as the return address, hence decoupling your application from its address at deploy time. 
	
	> Of course, there are many security considerations to be made about this solution. To name one, this will often lead to a red address bar in Internet Explorer, since the subject of the certificate used to secure the website will match the URI only when the project is deployed in the production environment. Furthermore, this opens the door to redirect attacks that will have to be mitigated at the STS side.
	
	> **Why do you use the Host header instead of just getting the Uri from HttpContext.Current.Request.Url**?

	> Microsoft Azure uses various network artifacts in its infrastructure: as a result, the Url property of the current http request would contain ports that are not really meaningful outside Microsoft Azure internals and that would cause problems, for example mess up with session cookies. The code provided ensures that the URI in the browser address bar will be used. 

1. On the **Global.asax.cs** file, add the **OnServiceConfigurationCreated** method.

	(Code Snippet - _Federated Authentication for WebRole Guide - RP Global.asax ServiceConfiguration_Created_)
	<!--mark: 4-17-->
	````C#
	public class Global : System.Web.HttpApplication
	{
	  ...
	  void OnServiceConfigurationCreated(object sender,     ServiceConfigurationCreatedEventArgs e)
	  {
		  //
		  // Use the <serviceCertificate> to protect the cookies that are
		  // sent to the client.
		  //
		  List<CookieTransform> sessionTransforms =
			new List<CookieTransform>(new CookieTransform[] {
			new DeflateCookieTransform(), 
			new RsaEncryptionCookieTransform(e.ServiceConfiguration.ServiceCertificate),
			new RsaSignatureCookieTransform(e.ServiceConfiguration.ServiceCertificate)  });
			SessionSecurityTokenHandler sessionHandler = new SessionSecurityTokenHandler(sessionTransforms.AsReadOnly());
			e.ServiceConfiguration.SecurityTokenHandlers.AddOrReplace(sessionHandler);
	  }
		...
	}
````
	
	>**Note:** What does **ServiceConfigurationCreated** do?

	>By default WIF **SessionTokens** use DPAPI to protect the content of Cookies that it sends to the client, however Microsoft Azure is a load balanced environment and as such, you need to ensure that every instance uses the same key, which is not the default behavior. In this case, we rely on **RsaEncryptionCookieTransform**, which we use for encrypting the cookies with the same certificate we are using for SSL in our website.

1. On the **Global.asax.cs** file, register the **OnServiceConfigurationCreated** handler in the **Application_Start** method.

	(Code Snippet - _Federated Authentication for WebRole Guide - RP Global.asax Application_Start_)
	<!--mark: 6-->
	````C#
	...
	public class Global : System.Web.HttpApplication
	{
		void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)
		{
			FederatedAuthentication.ServiceConfigurationCreated += OnServiceConfigurationCreated;
		}
	...
	}
	````

#### Task 2 - Creating a Local Development STS ####

1. Right-click on the solution and choose **Add | New Web Site**. Pick **ASP.NET Security Token Service Web Site**. Choose location **HTTP**, specify **https://localhost/[yourprojectname]_sts** to create it on your local IIS. Make sure that the Framework is **.NET Framework 4** and click **OK**.

	![Creating your local STS website](images/creating-your-local-sts-website.png?raw=true "Creating your local STS website")

	_Creating your local STS website_

1. Open **CustomSecurityTokenService.cs** in **https://localhost/[yourprojectname]_sts/App_Code**. Add the following method to the **CustomSecurityTokenService** class, just above **GetScope**.

	(Code Snippet - _Federated Authentication for WebRole Guide - STS ValidateReplyTo_)
	<!--mark: 4-28-->
	````C#
	public class CustomSecurityTokenService : SecurityTokenService
	{

				string host = (new Uri(replyTo)).Host.ToLower();
				if (!((host == "127.0.0.1")
					|| (host == "localhost")

		{
			ValidateAppliesTo( request.AppliesTo );
	  ...
	}
	````
	
1. At the beginning of **GetScope**, add a call to **ValidateReplyTo** that was added in the previous step.
	
	(Code Snippet - _Federated Authentication for WebRole Guide - ValidateReplyTo Call_)
	<!--mark: 5-->
	````C#
	 ...
		protected override Scope GetScope( IClaimsPrincipal principal, RequestSecurityToken request )
		{
			ValidateAppliesTo( request.AppliesTo );
			ValidateReplyTo(request.ReplyTo);
 
			//
			// Note: The signing certificate used by default has a Distinguished name  of "CN=STSTestCert",
			// and is located in the Personal certificate store of the Local Computer. Before going into production,
			// ensure that you change this certificate to a valid CA-issued certificate as appropriate.
			//
			Scope scope = new Scope( request.AppliesTo.Uri.OriginalString, SecurityTokenServiceConfiguration.SigningCredentials );
	
	...
	````
	
1. At the end of **GetScope**, replace the current **scope.ReplyToAddress** assignment with the following highlighted code.

	(Code Snippet - _Federated Authentication for WebRole Guide - STS Redirect to ReplyTo_)
	<!--mark: 7-->
	````C#
	protected override Scope GetScope( IClaimsPrincipal principal, RequestSecurityToken request )
	{
	  ...
	  // Set the ReplyTo address for the WS-Federation passive protocol (wreply). This is the address to which responses will be directed. 
	  // In this template, we have chosen to set this to the AppliesToAddress.
	
	  scope.ReplyToAddress = String.IsNullOrEmpty(request.ReplyTo) ? scope.AppliesToAddress : request.ReplyTo;
 
	  return scope;
	}
````


	>**Note**:  **Why do we make those changes to the default local STS auto-generated by the Federation Utility wizard?**

	>In Task 1, you modified the Global.asax of your application to ensure that it would send its actual URI to the STS, by storing it in the wreply parameter.
	
	>The ValidateReplyTo ensures that the address in the wreply refers to an application on your local machine (as in the Microsoft Azure compute emulator case) or from a host ending with .cloudapp.net (as in the Microsoft Azure staging or production environments case). This mitigates redirection attacks, as it limits the accepted ReplyTo values to addresses of Microsoft Azure applications. Note that this check would prevent you from using a domain name not matching the Microsoft Azure schema; hence, if you plan to map Microsoft Azure applications through a custom domain, you will have to adjust the code accordingly.

	>The assignment of scope.ReplyToAddress is modified to take the value of wreply, if present. If no wreply parameter is available in the request, the assignment will fold back to the default behavior (using the AppliesTo uri).

#### Task 3 - Establishing a Trust Relationship between the Web Role and the Development STS ####

1. Go to **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **FederatedIdentity_WebRole** project and choose **Add STS reference**. Accept the proposed location for the application configuration file, set the **Application URI** to **https://\<yourProjectName\>.cloudapp.net**, where **\<yourProjectName\>** is the name chosen for your cloud project (e.g. https://fabrikamair.cloudapp.net/) and click **Next**.

	![Summary](images/summary.png?raw=true "Summary")

	_Summary_

1. Add the **serviceCertificate** element in the **Web.config** of the **FederatedIdentity_WebRole** project under **microsoft.identityModel\service**. Update the placeholder in the **findValue** attribute with the corresponding thumbprint from the **ServiceConfiguration.Cloud.cscfg** file.

	(Code Snippet - _Federated Authentication for WebRole Guide - ServiceCertificate_)
	<!--mark: 4-6-->
	````XML
	 <microsoft.identityModel>
		  <service>
			...
			<serviceCertificate>
			  <certificateReference x509FindType="FindByThumbprint" findValue="[yourCorrespondingThumbprint]"/>
			</serviceCertificate>
		  </service>
	</microsoft.identityModel>
	````

	
1. Add the **certificateValidation** element under the **microsoft.identityModel\service** element and set the **certificateValidationMode** attribute to **None**.

	(Code Snippet - _Federated Authentication for WebRole Guide - CertificateValidation_)
	<!--mark: 5-->
	````XML
	<microsoft.identityModel>
		  <service>
			...
			</serviceCertificate>
			<certificateValidation certificateValidationMode="None"/>
		  </service>
	</microsoft.identityModel>
	````

	
	>**Note:**  We expect the token we receive to be signed with the private key of the STS we trust. The **Add STS Reference** wizard we went through in steps 1 to 5 saved in the element **issuerNameRegistry** of web.config the thumbprint of the certificate of the STS we trust. Once we receive a token, WIF uses this information for:

	>- Retrieving the corresponding certificate
	>- Using the certificate for checking the token signature
	>- Verifying that the signer was indeed listed in the issuerNameRegistry element, hence trusted
	In order to perform those operations, WIF can use the thumbprint for retrieving the bits of the STS certificate from the certificate store. However, certificate handling in Microsoft Azure requires extra operations, hence here we use an alternative method. Very often the request containing the token will also contain the bits of the certificate corresponding to the signature: this means that our application can use the thumbprint for retrieving the certificate from the request itself rather than relying on having the bits available locally. Setting the **certificateValidationMode** to **None** has the purpose of enabling the latter scenario.

	>Note that the request does not have to contain the bits of the certificate, and for certain platforms this wont be the default behavior: in those cases you will need to deploy in Microsoft Azure the public key (that is to say the certificate) of the STS as well, as shown in step 9 of task 5.
 
	[ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) by default validates all the POSTs done to the web application. This validation checks that the input is not dangerous. For instance, a piece of XML that is not encoded is considered dangerous for [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET). A token is a piece of XML that is not encoded. To avoid getting an exception when the token is posted, you will add a class that will check if the input is a token. If it is, it will return true and will let the request to continue. If not, it will throw the regular "A _potentially dangerous_ Request.Form value was detected..." exception.

1. Add the **SampleRequestValidator.cs** file from the assets folder, to the **FederatedIdentity_WebRole** project.

1. Open the **Web.config** file from the **FederatedIdentity_WebRole** project, add the **httpRuntime** element inside the **configuration\system.web** element and set the **requestValidationType** attribute to **SampleRequestValidator.**
 
	<!--mark: 2-->
	````XML
	...
		  <httpRuntime requestValidationType="SampleRequestValidator" />
		</system.web>
	````

	>**Note:** Make sure you add the **httpRuntime** element inside the general **system.web** element and not the one that is inside the element **\<location path =FederationMetadata>**.

#### Task 4 - Testing FabrikamAir in the Microsoft Azure Compute Emulator ####


In this task you will run the web application in the Microsoft Azure compute emulator, while the development STS we created in Task 2 will take care of authenticating users while running in the local IIS.

![Local Deployment](images/local-deployment.png?raw=true "Local Deployment")

_Local Deployment_

1. You are finally ready to test the application in the Microsoft Azure compute emulator. Set the cloud project as the startup project. To do this, in **Solution Explorer**, right-click the Microsoft Azure project and choose **Set as StartUp Project**.

1. Press **F5** to build and run the application. A browser page will open, pointing to <https://127.0.0.1:8080>. In the first screen, you will observe a certificate warning because the Microsoft Azure compute emulator uses an IP address for navigating to your application, while the certificate you are using refers to the address that the application will have once deployed in production in the cloud. Click **Continue to this website**.

	![Certificate Warning](images/certificate-warning.png?raw=true "Certificate Warning")

	_Certificate Warning_

	> **Note:** The browser informs us that there is a discrepancy between the page address and the subject  of the certificate used for the SSL binding: this is expected given the way in which Microsoft Azure compute emulator handles addresses.

1. You will be redirected to the local STS page that is hosted on your local IIS. Click **Submit**.

	![Authentication page](images/authentication-page.png?raw=true "Authentication page")

	_Authentication page_

	>**Note:** The default authentication page presented by local STS. Note the address bar: the STS still runs on the local IIS.

1. The STS issues the token and redirects to the Web Role application hosted in the Microsoft Azure compute emulator; WIF validates the token and grants the user access to the site. The red address bar once again indicates that the certificate you are using is already the one you will use in the cloud, hence the subject does not correspond to the URL shown in the browser. Close the browser and go back to Visual Studio.

	![Running Web application](images/running-web-application.png?raw=true "Running Web application")

	> **Note:** The web application hosted in the Microsoft Azure compute emulator successfully authenticated the user, and correctly processed the incoming token as shown on the page. The address bar is red, as expected for applications in the Microsoft Azure compute emulator.

#### Task 5 - Publishing CloudFabrikamAir in the Cloud and Testing it in Staging and Production ####


Now that you verified that the application works as expected in the Microsoft Azure compute emulator, you are ready to deploy it to the cloud and test it there. 
	
![Cloud Deployment](images/exercise-summary.png?raw=true "Cloud Deployment")

_Cloud Deployment_

In this task you will publish your project to the staging environment, test it, and finally move it to the production environment 
	
>**Note:** Please remember that to be able to deploy in the cloud you need an account on the Management Portal.

>Steps of this task assume that you comply with the above requirement, that you have a subscription in place but that you did not create a service for this application yet.
	
1. Navigate to <https://manage.windowsazure.com/> using a web browser and sign in using your Windows account.

	![Signing in to the Management Portal](images/signing-in-to-the-management-portal.png?raw=true "Signing in to the Management Portal")

	_Signing in to the Management Portal_

1. Create the Cloud Service that will host the application. To do this, click **NEW** | **Cloud Service** | **Quick Create**. Enter a service URL prefix in the textbox labeled **URL**, use same project name you used to generate the certificates in task 1. Finally pick a region from the **Region/Affinity Group** drop down and click **OK**.

	![Creating a new Cloud Service](images/creating-cloud-service.png?raw=true "Creating a new Cloud Service")

	_Creating a new Cloud Service_

1. Before we can upload our package to the cloud, we need to ensure that our target environment will have all the certificates it needs for allowing our application to function as expected. 

	>**Note:** In step 11 of task 1 we picked a certificate from the local certificate store to act as the SSL certificate for our application. Now that we are preparing to deploy our application to the cloud, we need to ensure that the certificate and its private key will be available in our target deployment environment. Note that in this lab we do not take advantage of token encryption: if we did, we would have to decide if we want to decrypt tokens with the same certificate we use for SSL (in which case we would already be all set) or if we would want to use another one. In the latter case, we would need to repeat the steps 10 to 13 below for uploading the pfx encrypting certificate and its private key.

	>Trust management via STS certificates requires some specific considerations: see the note in step 7 of task 3.

1. To manage Azure Certificates, you need to access the previous management portal version. In order to do this, hover the mouse pointer over **Preview** in the main page header and click **Take me to the previous portal**.

	![switching-to-previous-portal](images/switching-to-previous-portal.png?raw=true "Switching to previous portal")

	_Switching to the previous portal_

1. Once in the Production Portal, Click **Hosted Services** and expand the project you have just created, select the Certificates folder and click **Add Certificate** on the **Hosted Service Certificates** ribbon.

	![Adding a certificate](images/adding-a-certificate.png?raw=true "Adding a certificate")

	_Adding a certificate_

1. Click **Browse** to select the SSL certificate created on Task 1, Step 7 and 8.

	![Select the SSL certificate to upload](images/select-the-ssl-certificate-to-upload.png?raw=true "Select the SSL certificate to upload")

	_Select the SSL certificate to upload_

1. Navigate to the folder where the certificate was created **\\Source\\Assets\\certs** and select the file called **\<yourpProjectName\>.cloudapp.net.pfx**.
	
	>**Note:** Make sure to select the .pfx file extension.

1. Type the password for the private key of your certificate and click on **Create**.

	![Private key password](images/private-key-password.png?raw=true "Private key password")

	_Private key password_

	![Uploaded certificate](images/uploaded-certificate.png?raw=true "Uploaded certificate")

	_Uploaded certificate_

1. Now that the certificate was uploaded, we are ready to deploy the solution to Microsoft Azure. The certificates must be successfully deployed before uploading the solution, otherwise the solution deployment will fail. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click on the cloud project **\<yourprojectname\>**, and choose **Package**. 

1. In the Package Microsoft Azure Project dialog, select **Cloud** as the **Service Configuration** and click **Package.** In this process, Visual Studio will generate the package and open the containing folder with the package and configuration file. You will use these files later.

	![Publish Microsoft Azure Project dialog  choosing the Create Service Package Only option](images/publish-windows-azure-project-dialog-choosing.png?raw=true "Publish Microsoft Azure Project dialog  choosing the Create Service Package Only option")

	_Publish Microsoft Azure Project dialog  choosing the Create Service Package Only option_

1. To continue deploying to Azure using the new portal, click **Take me to the new portal** at the bottom of the page.

	![Go to the New Azure Portal](images/go-to-the-new-azure-portal.png?raw=true "Go to the New Azure Portal")

	_Go to the New Azure Portal_

1. Once in the new portal, upload and deploy your project to Staging environment. Select your Cloud Service from the **Cloud Services** page and click its **Name** field.

	![Picking your Cloud Service](images/select-your-cloud-service.png?raw=true "Picking your Cloud Service")

	_Picking your Cloud Service_

1. In the fabrikam Cloud Service page, select **Staging** and click **Upload New Staging Deployment**.

	![Publishing to Staging](images/publishing-to-staging.png?raw=true "Publishing to Staging")

	_Publishing to Staging_

1. In the **Upload a Package** dialog, you will be prompted to select the **Package** and **Configuration** files that you generated from Visual Studio in step 11 of this task: you can find them in the file system location indicated by the Windows Explorer window that opened when you published the package. Once both file paths have been selected, enter a Deployment Name (e.g: the current date) in the Deployment name field, select **Deploy even if one or more roles contain a single instance** and click **OK**.

	![Package Upload to Staging](images/package-upload-to-staging.png?raw=true "Package Upload to Staging")

	_Package Upload to Staging_

1. The application will spend some time **Initializing** (this might take 10 minutes at most). Once it is **Running** in **Staging** environment, the page will refresh. Scroll down and click the **Site URL** link.

	![Uploading application package](images/uploading-application-package.png?raw=true "Uploading application package")

	_Uploading application package_

	![Accessing Site URL](images/access-site-url.png?raw=true "Accessing Site URL")

	_Accessing Site URL_

1. A new browser will open, and you will get an error since the link is on http while you exposed only on https. Add the s to the protocol and the port number (i.e. http**s**://16c6c035e158424aaa5322837f7291e7.cloudapp.net**:8080**) in the address bar, and press **ENTER**. A certificate warning will be issued, since the staging URL, that contains a Guid, does not correspond to the certificate fabrikamair.cloudapp.net; you will be redirected to the development STS on your localhost; finally, you will land on the staging application where you will successfully authenticate.
	
	![The web application running in Staging environment](images/the-web-application-running-in-staging-enviro.png?raw=true "The web application running in Staging environment")

	_The web application running in Staging environment_

1. Now you are finally ready to promote the deployment to **Production**. Ensure the current deployment is selected and click the **Swap** button from the bottom pane. Click **YES** on the VIP Swap dialog.

	![Swap from Staging to Production](images/swap-from-staging-to-production.png?raw=true "Swap from Staging to Production")

	![Swap VIPs dialog](images/swap-vips-dialog.png?raw=true "Swap VIPs dialog")

	_Swap VIPs dialog_

1. The project is now deployed and running in production. Click the **DNS name** link. You will need to manually add the s to the protocol and the port number (i.e. http**s**://\<yourProjectName>.cloudapp.net**:8080**) in the address bar, and press **ENTER**. This time you will not receive any certificate warning because the DNS name matches the certificate you uploaded. The browser will be redirected to the local STS running on your local IIS. Click **Submit** to authenticate. The home page of the website will show the claims issued by the STS.

## Summary ##

Taking advantage of existing identities in new applications is one of the fundamental requirements in todays distributed systems, and the new wave of cloud based services is no exception.

By completing this hands-on lab you have learned:

- How to externalize authentication for a Microsoft Azure Web Role application, by taking advantage of Windows Identity Foundation for federating with an external authority (here simulated by a development STS).

- [Optional] How to deploy such an application in Microsoft Azure and take care of the operations (such as deploying certificates) that are necessary for making the application work as expected in federated and SSO scenarios.

As you have discovered while going through the lab, the claims-based approach to identity enabled by Windows Identity Foundation can be applied with little or no modification to both on-premises or cloud application.
 
We hope that the programming skills you learned in this and the other identity labs will enable you to write solutions with the confidence that no matter where your application will end up being deployed, you took care of identity in consistent and effective manner.
