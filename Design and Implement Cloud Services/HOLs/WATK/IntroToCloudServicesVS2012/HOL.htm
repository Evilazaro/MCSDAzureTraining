<h1>Introduction to Cloud Services</h1>

<hr>

<p><a name="Overview"></a></p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>When you create an application and run it in Windows Azure, the code and configuration together are called a Windows Azure cloud service. By creating a cloud service, you can deploy a multi-tier application in Windows Azure, defining multiple roles to distribute processing and allow flexible scaling of your application.</p>

<p>A cloud service consists of one or more web roles and/or worker roles, each with its own application files and configuration. Web roles provide a dedicated Internet Information Services (IIS) web server that can be used for hosting the web front-end of your cloud service. Application code hosted within worker roles can run tasks in the background that are asynchronous, long-running, or perpetual.</p>

<p>Storage services provide storage in the cloud, which includes Blob services for storing text and binary data, Table services for structured storage that can be queried, and Queue services for reliable and persistent messaging between services.</p>

<p>In this hands-on lab, you will explore the basic elements of a Windows Azure Cloud Service by creating a simple GuestBook application that demonstrates many features of web and worker roles, blob storage, table storage, and queues.</p>

<p>In the GuestBook application, a web role provides the front-end that allows users to view the contents of the guest book and submit new entries. Each entry contains a name, a message, and an associated picture. The application also contains a worker role that can generate thumbnails for the images that users submit.</p>

<p>When users post a new item, the web role uploads the picture to blob storage and creates an entry in table storage that contains the information entered by the user and a link to the blob with the picture. The web role renders this information to the browser so users can view the contents of the guest book.</p>

<p>After storing the image and creating the entry, the web role posts a work item to a queue to have the image processed. The worker role fetches the work item from the queue, retrieves the image from blob storage, and resizes it to create a thumbnail. Using queues to post work items is a common pattern in cloud applications and enables the separation of compute-bound tasks from the front-end. The advantage of this approach is that front and back ends can be scaled independently.</p>

<h4>Task 1 – Creating the Visual Studio Project</h4>

<p>In this task, you create a new Cloud Service project in Visual Studio.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Open <strong>Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 Express for Web</strong> as administrator by right clicking the <strong>Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 Express for Web</strong> shortcut and choosing <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>If the <strong>User Account Control</strong> dialog appears, click <strong>Yes</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>From the <strong>File</strong> menu, choose <strong>New Project</strong>.  </p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>New Project dialog</strong>, expand <strong>Visual C#</strong> in the <strong>Installed</strong> list and select <strong>Cloud</strong>. Choose the <strong>Windows Azure Cloud Service</strong> template, set the Name of the project to <strong>GuestBook</strong>, the location to <strong>\Source\Ex1-BuildingYourFirstWindowsAzureApp</strong>, change the solution name to <strong>Begin</strong>, and ensure that <strong>Create directory for solution</strong> is checked. Click <strong>OK</strong> to create the project.</p>

</p>

<p><em>Creating a new Windows Azure Cloud Service project</em></p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>New Windows Azure Cloud Service</strong> dialog, inside the <strong>Roles</strong> panel, expand the <strong>Visual C#</strong> tab. Select <strong>ASP.NET Web Role</strong> from the list of available roles and click the arrow <strong>(&gt;)</strong> to add an instance of this role to the solution. Before closing the dialog, select the new role in the right panel, click the pencil icon and rename the role as <strong>GuestBook_WebRole</strong>. Click <strong>OK</strong> to create the cloud service solution.</p>

</p>

<p><em>Assigning roles to a Cloud Service project</em></p></li>
<li><p>In <strong>Solution Explorer</strong>, review the structure of the created solution.</p>

<p><img src="Images/solution-explorer-guestbook.png?raw=true" alt="Solution Explorer showing the GuestBook application" title="Solution Explorer showing the GuestBook application">
</p>

<p><em>Solution Explorer showing the GuestBook application</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The generated solution contains two separate projects. The first project, named <strong>GuestBook</strong>, holds the configuration for the web and worker roles that compose the cloud application. It includes the service definition file, <strong>ServiceDefinition.csdef</strong>, which contains metadata needed by the Windows Azure fabric to understand the requirements of your application, such as which roles are used, their trust level, the endpoints exposed by each role, the local storage requirements and the certificates used by the roles. The service definition also establishes configuration settings specific to the application. The service configuration files specify the number of instances to run for each role and sets the value of configuration settings defined in the service definition file. This separation between service definition and configuration allows you to update the settings of a running application by uploading a new service configuration file.</p>

<p>You can create many configuration files, each one intended for a specific scenario such as production, development, or QA, and select which to use when publishing the application. By default, Visual Studio creates two files <strong>ServiceConfiguration.Local.cscfg</strong> and <strong>ServiceConfiguration.Cloud.cscfg</strong>.</p>

<p>The Roles node in the cloud service project enables you to configure which roles the service includes (web, worker or both) as well as which projects to associate with these roles. Adding and configuring roles through the Roles node will update the <strong>ServiceDefinition.csdef</strong> and <strong>ServiceConfiguration.cscfg</strong> files.</p>

<p>The second project, named <strong>GuestBook_WebRole</strong>, is a standard ASP.NET Web Application project template modified for the Windows Azure environment. It contains an additional class that provides the entry point for the web role and contains methods to manage the initialization, starting, and stopping of the role.</p>

<h4>Task 2 – Creating a Data Model for Entities in Table Storage</h4>

<p>The application stores guest book entries in Table storage. The Table service offers semi-structured storage in the form of tables that contain collections of entities. Entities have a primary key and a set of properties, where a property is a name, typed-value pair. </p>

<p>In addition to the properties required by your model, every entity in Table Storage has two key properties: the <strong>PartitionKey</strong> and the <strong>RowKey</strong>. These properties together form the table's primary key and uniquely identify each entity in the table. Entities also have a <strong>Timestamp</strong> system property, which allows the service to keep track of when an entity was last modified. This field is intended for system use and should not be accessed by the application.
The Table Storage client API provides a <strong>TableServiceEntity</strong> class that defines the necessary properties. Although you can use the <strong>TableServiceEntity</strong> class as the base class for your entities, this is not required.</p>

<p>The Table service API is compliant with the REST API provided by <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc668792.aspx">WCF Data Services</a> (formerly ADO.NET Data Services Framework) allowing you to use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc668772.aspx">WCF Data Services Client Library</a> (formerly .NET Client Library) to work with data in Table Storage using .NET objects.</p>

<p>The Table service does not enforce any schema for tables making it possible for two entities in the same table to have different sets of properties. Nevertheless, the GuestBook application uses a fixed schema to store its data. </p>

<p>In order to use the WCF Data Services Client Library to access data in table storage, you need to create a context class that derives from <strong>TableServiceContext</strong>, which itself derives from <strong>DataServiceContext</strong> in WCF Data Services. The Table Storage API allows applications to create the tables that they use from these context classes. For this to happen, the context class must expose each required table as a property of type <strong>IQueryable&lt;SchemaClass&gt;</strong>, where <strong>SchemaClass</strong> is the class that models the entities stored in the table. </p>

<p>In this task, you model the schema of the entities stored by the GuestBook application and create a context class to use WCF Data Services to access the information in table storage. To complete the task, you create an object that can be data bound to data controls in ASP.NET and implements the basic data access operations: read, update, and delete.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a new project for the schema classes. To create the project, right-click the <strong>Begin</strong> solution, point to <strong>Add</strong> and then select <strong>New Project</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Add New Project</strong> dialog, expand the language of your choice under the <strong>Installed</strong> tree view, select the <strong>Windows</strong> category, and then choose the <strong>Class Library</strong> project template. Set the name to <em>GuestBook_Data</em>, leave the proposed location inside the solution folder unchanged, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Creating a class library for GuestBook entities</em></p></li>
<li><p>Delete the default class file generated by the class library template. To do this, right-click <strong>Class1.cs</strong> and choose <strong>Delete</strong>. Click <strong>OK</strong> in the confirmation dialog.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a reference to the .NET Client Library for WCF Data Services in the <strong>GuestBook_Data project</strong>. In <strong>Solution Explorer</strong>, right-click the <strong>GuestBook_Data</strong> project node, select <strong>Add Reference</strong>, click the <strong>Framework</strong> tab, select the <strong>System.Data.Services.Client</strong> component and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Adding a reference to the System.Data.Service.Client component</em></p></li>
<li><p>Add a reference to the Windows Azure Storage Client in the <strong>GuestBook_Data project</strong>. In <strong>Solution Explorer</strong>, right-click the <strong>GuestBook_Data</strong> project node, select <strong>Add Reference</strong>, click the <strong>Extensions</strong> tab, select the <strong>Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage</strong> and <strong>Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Configuration</strong> component and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

</p>

<p><em>Adding a reference to the Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage and Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Configuration component</em></p></li>
<li><p>Before you can store an entity in a table, you must first define its schema. To do this, right-click <strong>GuestBook_Data</strong> in <strong>Solution Explorer</strong>, point to <strong>Add</strong> and select <strong>Class</strong>. In the <strong>Add New Item</strong> dialog, set the name to <strong>GuestBookEntry.cs</strong> and click <strong>Add</strong>.</p>

<h4>Task 3 – Creating a Web Role to Display the Guest Book and Process User Input</h4>

<p>In this task, you update the web role project that you generated in Task 1, when you created the Windows Azure Cloud Service solution. This involves updating the UI to render the list of guest book entries. For this purpose, you will find a page that has the necessary elements in the <strong>Assets</strong> folder of this exercise, which you will add to the project. Next, you implement the code necessary to store submitted entries in table storage and images in blob storage. To complete this task, you configure the storage account used by the Web role.</p>

If you are building a cloud service that employs storage services or writing any external application that calls storage services, you can test locally against the Storage emulator.</p>

<p>To use the storage emulator, you set the value of the <strong>UseDevelopmentStorage</strong> keyword in the connection string for the storage account to true.

<h4>Verification</h4>

<p>The Windows Azure compute emulator, formerly Development Fabric or devfabric, is a simulated environment for developing and testing Windows Azure applications in your machine. In this task, you launch the GuestBook application in the emulator and create one or more guest book entries.</p>

<p>Among the features available in the Windows Azure Tools for Microsoft Visual Studio is a Storage browser that allows you to connect to a storage account and browse the blobs and tables it contains. If you are using this version of Visual Studio, you will use it during this task to examine the storage resources created by the application.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Press <strong>F5</strong> to execute the service. The service builds and then launches the local Windows Azure compute emulator. To show the Compute Emulator UI, right-click its icon located in the system tray and select <strong>Show Compute Emulator UI</strong>.</p>

<h3>Exercise 2: Background Processing with Worker Roles and Queues</h3>

<p>A worker role runs in the background to provide services or execute time related tasks like a service process. 
In this exercise, you create a worker role to read work items posted to a queue by the web role front-end. To process the work item, the worker role extracts information about a guest book entry from the message and then retrieves the corresponding entity from table storage. It then fetches the associated image from blob storage and creates its thumbnail, which it also stores as a blob. Finally, to complete the processing, it updates the URL of the generated thumbnail blob in the guest book entry.</p>

<p><a name="Ex2Task1"></a></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Even though the code shown above uses classes in the System.Drawing namespace for simplicity, you should be aware that the classes in this namespace were designed for use with Windows Forms. They are not supported for use within a Windows or ASP.NET service. You should conduct exhaustive testing if you intend to use these classes in your own Windows Azure applications.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The worker role also uses Storage services and you need to configure your storage account settings, just as you did in the case of the web role. To create the storage account setting, in <strong>Solution Explorer</strong>, expand the <strong>Roles</strong> node of the <strong>GuestBook</strong> project, double-click <strong>GuestBook_WorkerRole</strong> to open the properties for this role and select the <strong>Settings</strong> tab. Click <strong>Add Setting</strong>, type <em>&quot;DataConnectionString&quot;</em> in the <strong>Name</strong> column, change the <strong>Type</strong> to <em>Connection String</em>, and then click the button labeled with an ellipsis. In the <strong>Create Storage Connection String</strong> dialog, choose the option labeled <strong>Windows Azure storage emulator</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>. Press <strong>CTRL + S</strong> to save your changes.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><a name="Ex2Verification"></a></p>

<h4>Verification</h4>

<p>You now launch the updated application in the Windows Azure compute emulator to verify that the worker role can retrieve queued work items and generate the corresponding thumbnails.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Press <strong>F5</strong> to launch the service in the local compute emulator. </p></li>
<li><p>Switch to Internet Explorer to view the application. If you completed the verification section of the previous exercise successfully, you will see the guest book entry that you entered, including the uploaded image displayed in its original size. If you recall, during the last task of that exercise, you updated the web role code to post a work item to a queue for each new entry submitted. These messages remain in the queue even though the web role was subsequently recycled. </p></li>
<li><p>Wait a few seconds until the worker role picks up the queued message and processes the image that you are viewing. Once that occurs, it generates a thumbnail for this image and updates the corresponding URL property for the entry in table storage. Eventually, because the page refreshes every few seconds, it will show the thumbnail image instead.</p>

<h3>Exercise 3: Publishing a Windows Azure Application</h3>

<p>In this exercise, you publish the application created in the previous exercise to Windows Azure using the Management Portal. First, you provision the required service components, upload the application package to the staging area and configure it. You then execute the application in the staging area to verify its operation. Finally, you promote the application to production.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In order to complete this exercise, you need to sign up for a Windows Azure account and purchase a subscription. 
For a description of the provisioning process, see <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/david_sayed/archive/2010/01/07/provisioning-windows-azure.aspx">Provisioning Windows Azure</a>.</p>

<h4>Task 1 – Creating a Storage Account and a Cloud Service Component</h4>

<p>The application you publish in this exercise requires both compute and storage services. In this task, you create a new Windows Azure affinity group where your services will reside. In addition, you create  a new storage account to allow the application to persist its data and a cloud service component to execute application code.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Navigate to <a href="https://manage.windowsazure.com"><a href="https://manage.windowsazure.com">https://manage.windowsazure.com</a></a> using a web browser and sign in using the Microsoft Account associated with your Windows Azure account.</p>

<p><img src="Images/sign-in.png?raw=true" alt="Signing in to the Windows Azure Management Portal" title="Signing in to the Windows Azure Management Portal">
</p>

<p><em>Signing in to the Windows Azure Management Portal</em></p></li>
<li><p>First, you create a new virtual network and an affinity group where your services will be deployed. In the Windows Azure menu, click <strong>NEW</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="Images/new-button.png?raw=true" alt="New button" title="New button">
</p>

<p><em>New button</em></p></li>
<li><p>In the Networks menu, click <strong>Virtual Network | Custom Create</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="Images/create-virtual-netowrk.png?raw=true" alt="Create Virtual Netowrk" title="Create Virtual Netowrk ">
</p>

<p><em>Create Virtual Netowrk</em></p></li>
<li><p>In the Create a Virtual Network dialog box complete the <strong>Name</strong> and in <strong>Affinity group</strong> select <em>Create a new affinity group</em>. Select the desired region and complete the <strong>Affinity Group Name</strong>. Click the arrow at the bottom of the dialog box.</p>

<p><img src="Images/create-virtual-network-dialog-box.png?raw=true" alt="Create Virtual Network dialog box" title="Create Virtual Network dialog box">
</p>

<p><em>Create Virtual Network dialog box</em></p></li>
<li><p>In the DNS Servers and VPN Connectivity, leave the DNS Servers empty and click <strong>Next</strong> at the bottom of the dialog box.</p>

<p><img src="Images/dns-servers-and-vpn-connectivity.png?raw=true" alt="DNS Servers and VPN Connectivity" title="DNS Servers and VPN Connectivity">
</p>

<p><em>DNS Servers and VPN Connectivity</em></p></li>
<li><p>In the Virtual Network Address Spaces window, leave the default values and finish the wizard.</p>

<p><img src="Images/virtual-network-address-spaces.png?raw=true" alt="Virtual Network Address Spaces" title="Virtual Network Address Spaces">
</p>

<p><em>Virtual Network Address Spaces</em></p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Networks</strong> Tab, wait until the network status changes to <em>Created</em>.</p>

<p><img src="Images/virtual-network-created.png?raw=true" alt="Virtual Network Created" title="Virtual Network Created">
</p>

<p><em>Virtual Network Created</em></p></li>
<li><p>Now you will create the cloud service were the application will be deployed. To do so, click the <strong>NEW</strong> button at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p><img src="Images/new-button.png?raw=true" alt="New button" title="New button">
</p>

<p><em>New button</em></p></li>
<li><p>Go to <strong>Compute | Cloud Service | Quick Create</strong>. In the textbox labeled <strong>URL</strong>, enter the name for your cloud service, for example, <strong>&lt;yourname&gt;guestbook</strong>, where <em>&lt;yourname&gt;</em> is a unique name. Windows Azure uses this value to generate the endpoint URLs for the storage account services. Then, select the drop down list labeled <strong>Region/Affinity group</strong> and pick the affinity group you created in the previous step. Click <strong>Create cloud service</strong> to start creating it.</p>

<p><img src="Images/new-cloud-service.png?raw=true" alt="New Cloud Service" title="New Cloud Service">
</p>

<p><em>New Cloud Service</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The portal ensures that the name is valid by verifying that the name complies with the naming rules and is currently available. A validation error will be shown if you enter a name that does not satisfy the rules.</p>

<p><img src="Images/warning-name-verification.png?raw=true" alt="Name verification" title="Name verification">
</p>

<p>Additionally, the reason that you can choose an affinity group is to deploy both the cloud service and storage account to the same location, thus ensuring high bandwidth and low latency between the application and the data it depends on.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Next, you will create the storage account where the application will store the data. To do so, click the <strong>NEW</strong> button at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p><img src="Images/new-button.png?raw=true" alt="New button" title="New button">
</p>

<p><em>New button</em></p></li>
<li><p>Go to <strong>Data Services | Storage | Quick Create</strong>. In the textbox labeled <strong>URL</strong>, enter the name for your storage account, for example, <strong>&lt;yourname&gt;guestbook</strong>, where <em>&lt;yourname&gt;</em> is a unique name. Then, select the drop down list labeled <strong>Region/Affinity group</strong>, pick the affinity group you created in the previous step and click <strong>Create Storage Account</strong>. Wait until the provisioning process completes and updates the <strong>Storage</strong> list view. </p></li>
<li><p>At the list view, click on the name of the new storage account.</p>

<p><img src="Images/select-storage-account.png?raw=true" alt="Select the storage account " title="Select the storage account">
</p>

<p><em>Select the storage</em></p></li>
<li><p>At the dashboard page, click <strong>Manage Keys</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="Images/view-keys.png?raw=true" alt="Manage keys " title="View keys">
</p>

<p><em>Manage keys</em></p></li>
<li><p>At the <strong>Manage Access Keys</strong> dialog, select and copy the primary key.</p>

<p><img src="Images/manage-access-keys.png?raw=true" alt="Primary and Secondary Access Keys " title="Primary and Secondary Access Keys">
</p>

<p><em>Primary and Secondary Access Keys</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>Primary Access Key</strong> and <strong>Secondary Access Key</strong> both provide a shared secret that you can use to access storage. The secondary key gives the same access as the primary key and is used for backup purposes. You can regenerate each key independently in case either one is compromised.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Do not close the browser window. You will use the portal for the next task.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><a name="Ex3Task2"></a></p>

<h4>Task 2 – Publishing the Application to the Windows Azure Management Portal</h4>

<p>There are several alternatives for publishing applications to Windows Azure. The Windows Azure Tools for Visual Studio allow you to both create and publish the service package to the Windows Azure environment directly from Visual Studio. Another deployment option is the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/jj156055">Windows Azure Service Management PowerShell Cmdlets</a> that enable a scripted deployment of your application. Lastly, the Windows Azure Management Portal provides the means to publish and manage your service using only your browser. For more information about publishing applications, see the <strong>Windows Azure Deployment</strong> lab in this training kit.</p>

<p>In this task, you publish the application to the staging environment using the Management Portal but first, you generate the service package using Visual Studio.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If it is not already open, launch <strong>Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 Express for Web</strong> as administrator by right clicking the <strong>Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 Express for Web</strong> shortcut and choosing <strong>Run as administrator</strong>. </p></li>
<li><p>If the <strong>User Account Control</strong> dialog appears, click <strong>Continue</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>File</strong> menu, choose <strong>Open Project</strong>. In the <strong>Open Project</strong> dialog, browse to <strong>\Source\Ex3-WindowsAzureDeployment</strong>. Select <strong>Begin.sln</strong> in the <strong>Begin</strong> folder and click <strong>Open</strong>. 
Alternatively, you may continue with the solution that you obtained after completing the previous exercise.</p></li>
<li><p>Expand the <strong>Roles</strong> folder in the <strong>GuestBook</strong> cloud project. Right-click the <strong>GuestBook_WebRole</strong> and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch to the <strong>Settings</strong> tab and locate the <em>DataConnectionString</em> settings.</p></li>
<li><p>Click in the <strong>Ellipsis</strong> located under the <strong>Value</strong> column for the <em>DataConnectionString</em>.</p>

<p><img src="Images/dataconnectionstring-settings.png?raw=true" alt="DataConnectionString settings" title="DataConnectionString settings">
</p>

<p><em>DataConnectionString settings</em></p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Create Storage Connection String</strong> dialog box, select <strong>Manually entered credentials</strong> and complete the <strong>Account name</strong> and <strong>Account key</strong> of the storage account you've created in the previous task. Then click <strong>OK</strong> to create the storage account.</p>

<p><img src="Images/create-storage-connection-string.png?raw=true" alt="Create Storage Connection String" title="Create Storage Connection String">
</p>

<p><em>Create Storage Connection String</em></p></li>
<li><p>Follow steps 5 to 7 to configure the connection string for the <strong>Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Plugins.Diagnostics.ConnectionString</strong> in the Web Role and configure the same connection strings for the Worker Role.</p></li>
<li><p>Generate the package to publish to the cloud. To do this, right-click the <strong>GuestBook</strong> cloud project and select <strong>Package</strong>. In the <strong>Package Windows Azure Application</strong> dialog, select the <strong>Service Configuration</strong> and the <strong>Build Configuration</strong> you will use from the dropdowns and then click <strong>Package</strong>. 
After Visual Studio builds the project and generates the service package, Windows Explorer opens with the current folder set to the location where the generated package is stored.</p>

<p><img src="Images/creating-a-service-package.png?raw=true" alt="Creating a service package in Visual Studio" title="Creating a service package in Visual Studio">
</p>

<p><em>Creating a service package in Visual Studio</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although the procedure is not shown here, you can use the Publish Cloud Service feature in the Windows Azure Tools to publish your service package directly from Visual Studio. To use this feature, you need to configure a set of credentials that you use to authenticate access to the management service using a self-issued certificate that you upload to the Management Portal.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Now, switch back to the browser window with the Management Portal opened.</p></li>
<li><p>In the cloud services list, click the name of the cloud service that you created before.</p>

<p><img src="Images/cloud-service.png?raw=true" alt="Cloud Service" title="Cloud Service">
</p>

<p><em>Cloud Service</em></p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Dashboard</strong> page, click <strong>Staging</strong> and then <strong>Upload a New Staging Environment</strong>. </p>

<p><img src="Images/deploy-to-staging-environment.png?raw=true" alt="Deploy to staging environment" title="Deploy to staging environment">
</p>

<p><em>Deploy to staging environment</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A cloud service is a service that runs your code in the Windows Azure environment. It has two separate deployment slots: staging and production. The staging deployment slot allows you to test your service in the Windows Azure environment before you deploy it to production.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Upload a Package</strong> dialog, enter a label to identify the deployment; for example, use <strong>FirstVersion</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The portal displays the label in its user interface for staging and production, allowing you to identify the version currently deployed in each environment.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>To select the <strong>Package</strong> from the file system, click <strong>From Local</strong>, navigate to the folder where Visual Studio generated the package in Step 6 and then select <strong>GuestBook.cspkg</strong>. </p></li>
<li><p>Now, to choose the <strong>Configuration</strong> file, click <strong>From Local</strong> and select <strong>ServiceConfiguration.cscfg</strong> in the same folder that you used in the previous step.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <em>.cscfg</em> file contains configuration settings for the application, including the instance count that you will update later in the exercise.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Finally, check the option labeled <strong>Deploy even if one or more roles contain a single instance</strong>. Click the <strong>Tick</strong> to start the deployment. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In this particular case, only a single instance is being deployed for at least one of the roles. This is not recommended because it does not guarantee the service’s availability. In the next task, you will increase the number of instances to overcome this issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="Images/upload-package-to-staging.png?raw=true" alt="Upload package to staging" title="Upload package to staging">
</p>

<p><em>Upload package to staging</em></p></li>
<li><p>Notice that the package begins to upload and that the portal shows the status of the deployment to indicate its progress. </p>

<p><img src="Images/uploading-cloud-service.png?raw=true" alt="Uploading cloud service" title="Uploading cloud service">
</p>

<p><em>Uploading cloud service</em></p></li>
<li><p>Wait until the deployment process finishes, which may take several minutes. At this point, you have already uploaded the package and it is in a <strong>Ready</strong> state.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> During deployment, Windows Azure analyzes the configuration file and copies the service to the correct number of machines, and starts all the instances. Load balancers, network devices and monitoring are also configured during this time.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>After succesfull deployment, go to the <strong>Cloud Services</strong> pages and click your cloud service name to view its dashboard. Notice the <strong>Site Url</strong> assigned to your deployment under the <strong>quick glance</strong> section.</p>

<p><img src="Images/cloud-service-dashboard.png?raw=true" alt="Cloud Service Dashboard" title="Cloud Service Dashboard">

</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p><a name="Ex3Task3"></a></p>

<h4>Task 3 – Configuring the Application to Increase the Number of Instances</h4>

<p>Before you can test the deployed application, you need to configure it. In this task, you define the storage account settings for the application.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In <strong>Cloud Services</strong>, click on your <strong>GuestBook</strong> service and click <strong>Scale</strong> on the ribbon.</p>

<p><img src="Images/scaling-instances.png?raw=true" alt="Scaling instances" title="Scaling instances">
</p>

<p><em>Scaling instances</em></p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Scale</strong> page, increase the instance count up to 2, for each role.</p>

<p><img src="Images/increment-instance-count.png?raw=true" alt="Increment instance count" title="Increment instance count">

</p>

<p><em>Increment instance count</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Alternatively, you can change the instance count entering the new number into the text boxes at right.</p>

<p>This setting controls the number of roles that Windows Azure starts and is used to scale the service. For a token-based subscription—currently only available in countries that are not provisioned for billing—this number is limited to a maximum of two instances. However, in the commercial offering, you can change it to any number that you are willing to pay for.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Save</strong> at bottom pane to update the configuration and wait for the cloud service to apply the new settings. </p>

<p><img src="Images/saving-instance-count.png?raw=true" alt="Saving the instance count" title="Saving the instance count">

</ol>

<p><a name="Ex3Task4"></a></p>

<h4>Task 4 – Testing the Application in the Staging Environment</h4>

<p>In this task, you run the application in the staging environment and access its public endpoint to test that it operates correctly.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Go to your cloud service's <strong>dashboard</strong> and then click the <strong>Site Url</strong> link under the <strong>quick glance</strong> section.</p>

<p><img src="Images/site-url.png?raw=true" alt="Site URL" title="Site URL">
</p>

<p><em>Site URL</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The link shown for Site URL name has the form <em>&lt;guid&gt;.cloudapp.net</em>, where <em><guid></em> is some random identifier. This is different from the address where the application will run once it is in production. Although the application executes in a staging area that is separate from the production environment, there is no actual physical difference between staging and production – it is simply a matter of where the load balancer is connected. </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>If you wish, you may test the application by signing the guest book and uploading an image.</p>

</ol>

<p><a name="Ex3Task5"></a></p>

<h4>Task 5 – Promoting the Application to Production</h4>

<p>Now that you have verified that the service is working correctly in the staging environment, you are ready to promote it to final production. When you deploy the application to production, Windows Azure reconfigures its load balancers so that the application is available at its production URL.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In <strong>Cloud Services</strong>, click on your service and then click <strong>Swap</strong> at the bottom menu.</p>

<p><img src="Images/promoting-to-the-production-s.png?raw=true" alt="Swap slots" title="Swap slots">

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you visit the production site shortly after its promotion, the DNS name might not be ready. If you encounter a DNS error (404), wait a few minutes and try again. Keep in mind that Windows Azure creates DNS name entries dynamically and that the changes might take few minutes to propagate.</p>

<li><p>Even when a deployment is in a suspended state, Windows Azure still needs to allocate a virtual machine for each instance and charge you for it. Once you have completed testing the application, you need to remove the deployment from Windows Azure to avoid an unnecessary expense. To remove a running deployment, go to <strong>Cloud Services</strong>, select the deployment slot where the service is currently hosted, staging or production, then click <strong>Stop</strong> on the bottom pane and accept the confirmation prompt. Once the service has stopped, click <strong>Delete</strong> on the bottom pane and click <strong>Delete the production deployment for cloud service yourusernameguestbook</strong> to remove it.</p></li>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>By completing this hands-on lab, you have reviewed the basic elements of Windows Azure applications. You have seen that services consist of one or more web roles and worker roles. You have learned about Storage services and in particular, Blob, Table and Queue services. Finally, you have explored a basic architectural pattern for cloud applications that allows front-end processes to communicate with back-end processes using queues.</p>
